Database Console

SQL console with autocompletion, inspections, error highlighting, autocompletion on joins, ...

Ctrl+Shift+F10 (Windows/Linux)
Shift+Command+F10 (Mac OS X)

1. Open a database console and copy in the contents of the workshop_database.sql file.
   Make sure the database name at the top is specified correctly and that the connected user can create a new database.
   In the exercises, we will be using database name "workshop" from now on.
2. We can execute SQL statements by selecting one or multiple. Select all statements in the console and execute
   the statement using the button in the toolbar or Ctrl+Enter (Command+Enter).
3. Synchronize (refresh) the database tool window and see the newly created database "workshop".
4. Edit the database connection (context menu, properties) and make sure it connects to the "workshop" database
   from now on. This will force PhpStorm to "know" about the database we are working with.
5. Open a new console and try typing the following query. Note the autocompletion on typing "person."

SELECT person.name FROM person

6. Execute the query and see the query results.
7. Type the following query:

SELECT person.name FROM people

8. Notice that just like with code, inspections tell us the table "people" does not exist.
9. Type the following query:

SELECT person.name, city.name as city, country.name as nationality
FROM person
  INNER JOIN city ON person.city_id = city.city_id
  INNER JOIN country ON

10. Now use smart autocompletion (Ctrl+Shift+Space) and note that the IDE proposes to complete the JOIN statement.
    Complete the query:

SELECT person.name, city.name as city, country.name as nationality
FROM person
  INNER JOIN city ON person.city_id = city.city_id
  INNER JOIN country ON country.country_id = person.nationality_country_id
WHERE country.name = ?

11. Execute the statement. The IDE prompts for the parameter which is noted in the query as ? (can also be :country or similar).
    In the dialog, enter 'Belgium' as the value (including quotes).
12. Explore the options in the results tool window.
