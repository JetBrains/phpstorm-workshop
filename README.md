# PhpStorm Workshop

In these materials, you'll learn about many of the features and productivity tools available in [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm) IDE. Examples are navigation, editing, inspections, live templates, refactoring, tools like Composer and the REST client and many more things. It's virtually impossible to cover every option and feature in PhpStorm, but we're providing a number of practical exercises on how we can do our daily work as a PHP developer.

We'll also cover a vast amount of keyboard shortcuts to make working with PhpStorm more efficient. Other IntelliJ IDEA based IDE's use the same keyboard shortcuts, so if you know how to work with PhpStorm, you'll know how to work with WebStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm, IntelliJ IDEA and more. A [cheat sheet is available online](http://bit.ly/phpstorm-shortcuts) and is also included in the workshop download.

This workshop is self-paced, meaning you can work your way through slides and exercises on your own, whenever and wherever you want. Exercises come as a PhpStorm project in which every file is a new exercise that may contain code and tips to get things done.

## Getting the Project
There are a couple of ways to get started with the PhpStorm workshop materials:

* Create a new project using Composer. Note that you can also create a new project in PhpStorm and use the Composer project type and search for "jetbrains/phpstorm-workshop"

    ``php composer.phar create-project jetbrains/phpstorm-workshop -s dev``

* Clone the project using GitHub

    ``git clone https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-workshop.git``

* Download the ZIP

    ``wget https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-workshop/archive/master.zip``

## Getting Started
There are some things to know about the project:

* The project can be opened as-is in PhpStorm. No settings are included in the project yet, because these are configured when following exercises.
* All numbered folders contain exercises that you can work on. Simply open the numbered files one by one and follow the comments in the file. Most exercises are self-contained, others build on previous exercises.
* The PhpStormWorkshop.pptx / PhpStormWorkshop.pdf is a slide deck which summarizes many of the items covered in exercises.
* The PhpStormReferenceCard.pdf is the PhpStorm keymap. The latest version can always be found on the [PhpStorm website](http://bit.ly/phpstorm-shortcuts).
