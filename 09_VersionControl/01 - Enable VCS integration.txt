Enabling VCS integration

Telling the IDE that the project is under a VCS system.

1. Explore the VCS menu.
   We can checkout code from an existing VCS like Git, Mercurial, Subversion, ...
   We can import the current project into a VCS system or share it on GitHub.
   We can enable VCS integration.

2. Use the VCS | Enable VCS integration menu and specify the project will be in a Git repository.
   This will create a .git folder in the project. In the Project Tool Window, notice the color of all files changes.
   The reason for that is the file is not yet under source control.
