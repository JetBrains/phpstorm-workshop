Version Control (VCS) - preparations

There are some preparations for the current exercise...
Since the Workshop project comes from GitHub, we will have to remove all existing VCS settings from PhpStorm in order to work with version control "from scratch".

1. Open the current project's root folder outside PhpStorm and remove the .git folder at the root.
2. From the Project Settings | Version Control, make sure that all VCS bindings are removed.
3. From the Project Settings | Version Control | Git, make sure the path to a Git executable is specified.
4. You are now good to go, the project should no longer be linked to any VCS.
