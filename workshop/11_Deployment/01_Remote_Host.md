# Remote Host

Copy files and folders back and forth between the local project and the server.

1. Using _Search Everywhere_, find the _Remote Host_ tool window.
2. Copy the existing `vm` server and specify _Root path_ to be `/home/vagrant` or click _Autodetect_.
3. Browse the remote host and copy some files from the current project to the remote server.
   This can be done either by dragging and dropping the flies or by using the context menu.
