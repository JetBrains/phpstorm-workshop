# Integration with VCS

Upload files to server when committing to source control.

1. Create a new file in the project and add it to VCS.
2. Commit pending changes to the VCS. In the _Commit Changes_ dialog, choose the created server in the _Upload files to_ list.

   Once files are committed to the VCS, PhpStorm will also upload changes to the remote host.
