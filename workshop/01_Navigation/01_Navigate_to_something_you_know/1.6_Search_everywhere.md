# Search Everywhere

> - Double Shift (Windows/Linux/macOS)

Search classes, files, symbols and menu actions all at once.


1. **Use recent files**

    Navigate to the `$_name` protected variable in `Customer.php` (type `_name`). Note that simply launching _Search Everywhere_ will display recent files without requiring to type anything.

2. **Use CamelHumps to navigate**

    Navigate to the `CustomerRepository` class using CamelHumps (type `CR` or `CusR`).

3. **Use middle matching to navigate**

   Navigate to the `DocumentRepository.php` file by searching for `Repo`.

4. **Search actions**

    Find the _Tip of the Day_ action and invoke it.

5. **Search for non-project classes**

   Select the _Include non-project items_ checkbox and open the `ArrayObject` (PHP SPL library) class. By default, PhpStorm only searches classes inside your project, not your dependencies in the `vendor` folder.
