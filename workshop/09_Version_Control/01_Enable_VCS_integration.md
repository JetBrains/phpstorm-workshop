# Enabling VCS integration

Tell the IDE that the project is under a version control system.

1. Explore the _VCS_ menu.
   We can checkout code from an existing VCS like Git, Mercurial, Subversion, ...
   We can import the current project into a VCS system or share it on GitHub.
   We can enable VCS integration.

2. Use the _VCS | Enable VCS Integration_ menu command and specify that the project will be in a Git repository.
   This will create a _.git_ folder in the project. In the _Project_ tool window, notice the color of all files changes.
   The reason for that is the file is not yet under the source control.
