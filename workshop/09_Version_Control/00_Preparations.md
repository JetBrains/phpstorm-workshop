# Version Control System (VCS) - preparations

This exercise requires performing several preparatory steps.
Since the Workshop project comes from GitHub, we need to remove all existing VCS settings from PhpStorm in order to start working with version control "from scratch".

1. Open the current project's root folder outside PhpStorm and remove the _.git_ folder at the root.
2. In the Settings | Version Control, make sure that all VCS bindings are removed.
3. In the Settings | Version Control | Git, make sure the path to a Git executable is specified.

You are now good to go, the project is no longer linked to any VCS.
