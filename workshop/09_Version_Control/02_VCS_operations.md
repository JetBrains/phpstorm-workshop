# VCS Operations

Perform operations on the version control system such as adding files, deleting files, committing changes and so on.

> * Alt+Backquote (Alt+`) (Windows/Linux)
> * Ctrl+V (macOS)

1. Add the current file to current changelist using the VCS Operations popup.
   Note that the color of the file changes in the Project Tool Window.
2. In Git, this does not mean the file is in the VS now: it's in the changelist.
   Using the VCS Operations popup, add all other project files as well.
   Note you can use the popup on any folder.
3. All files should be green now, meaning they are added to the current changelist.
