# Command Line Tools

Invoke command line tools shipped with frameworks and libraries. Composer, Zend Framework, Symfony,
Symfony Console-based, Drush or roll your own. Autocompletion support. Not meant to be a full console/terminal!

> * Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux)

1. We can use Command Line Tools for working with Composer (and other tools).
   Command Line Tools can be added globally (for all projects) or per project. We'll add Composer for the current project.
   From the _Settings | Tools | Command Line Tool Support_, add a new tool.
   Add Composer as a tool. Note that Zend Framework, Symfony, Symfony Console-based, Drush are also supported.
   In the next step, specify the path to `composer.phar`.
2. After you click _OK_, the tool is added with a `c` alias, which means that we can now invoke Composer as `c`.
   Open the _Command Line Tools_ using the keyboard shortcut. Type `c`.
   Note the autocompletion support. Select the `require` command and specify `psr/log:1.0.*@dev` as the package:
    `c require "psr/log:1.0.*@dev"`

   This will install the `psr/log` package at the project root.
3. Let's add a _Custom Tool_. From the _Settings | Tools | Command Line Tool Support_, add a new tool.
   Select Custom Tool as the tool type. Specify the path to `helloworld.sh` or `helloworld.bat` in the current folder,
   depending on your system. Set the tool alias to `hw`.
4. Invoke the newly create _hw_ tool from the _Command Line Tools_ console: `hw to Maarten`
5. To add autocompletion to the custom tool, go to _Settings | Tools | Command Line Tool Support_
   and click the _Open Definition in Editor_ button from the toolbar. This will open an XML file in which we can add
   the autocompletion information. Replace the file contents with:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <framework xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="schemas/frameworkDescriptionVersion1.1.3.xsd" name="Custom_hw" invoke="C:\Users\Maarten\Desktop\Workshop\11_Tools\helloworld.bat" alias="hw" enabled="true" version="2">
      <help><![CDATA[Hello World]]></help>
        <command>
            <name>to</name>
            <help>Say hello to someone.</help>
            <params>name</params>
        </command>
    </framework>
    ```

6. Invoke the newly create _hw_ tool from the _Command Line Tools_ console. Note autocompletion information is available now.
