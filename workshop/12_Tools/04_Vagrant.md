# Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool which helps us create reproducible development environments by scripting a virtual machine.

1. Once the machine is up, you can pause it using _Tools | Vagrant | Suspend_.
2. Once the machine is paused, you can resume it using _Tools | Vagrant | Resume_.
3. We will use the Vagrant machine during the workshop, so keep it running. The machine can be destroyed
   using _Tools | Vagrant | Destroy_.
