Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool which helps us create reproducible development environments by scripting a virtual machine.

1. Once the machine is up, you can pause it using Tools | Vagrant | Suspend.
2. Once the machine is paused, you can resume it using Tools | Vagrant | Resume.
3. We will use the Vagrant machine during the workshop so keep it running, remember it can be destroyed
   using Tools | Vagrant | Destroy.
