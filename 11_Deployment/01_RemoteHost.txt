Remote Host

Copy files and folders back and forth between local project and server.

1. Using Search Everywhere, fond the Remote Host tool window.
2. Add a new Deployment Server. Note that the type of server can be FTP, FTPS, SFTP, Local or Mounted Folder or In Place.
   This is the method PhpStorm will use to connect to the remote server.

   If you have a server available, add it. If not, add a Local or Mounted Folder and pretend it's a server.
   The folder to configure can be any folder on your system.
3. Configure the path to the server. Note that we can also specify a URL to it, which can be useful
   to run remote unit tests or remote debugging.
   In the Mappings tab, specify the content root on the server. This can be a different subfolder or just /.
4. Browse the remote host and copy some files from the current project to the remote server.
   This can be done using drag and drop, or using the context menu.
