Integration with VCS

Upload files to server when committing to source control.

1. Create a new file in the project and add it to source control.
2. Commit pending changes to the VCS. In the commit dialog, set the "Upload files to"
   dropdown to the server created earlier.

   Once files are committed to the VCS, PhpStorm will also upload changes to the remote host.
